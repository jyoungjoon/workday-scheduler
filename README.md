# Workday Scheduler

This is a simple scheduler application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery.

## Description

![Workday Scheduler](./Assets/image/screen-shot.png)

 It uses the day.js library to work with date and time. The application displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time block represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time
* A field to hold user input
* A save button

 Save button will store the time and user input in local storage. When the user refreshes the page, the saved events will still be there.

 Modal will pop up only on the first load of the application. You can close the modal by clicking the close button or by clicking outside of the modal. You can also close it by pressing down the ESC key.
